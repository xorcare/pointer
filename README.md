Package pointer contains helper routines for simplifying the creation
of optional fields of basic type.

## A little copying is better than a little dependency

With the advent of generics in go 1.18, using this library in your code is
likely to be unwarranted, I recommend that you make a small local copy of this
library, for example:

Put the code below in the file: `internal/pointer/pointer.go` and use it at
your own pleasure.

```go
package pointer

// Of is a helper routine that allocates a new any value
// to store v and returns a pointer to it.
func Of[Value any](v Value) *Value {
    return &v
}
```

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/xorcare/pointer
```

## Generics

Starting with Go 18+, you can use the `Of` method to get pointers to values of any types.

## Examples

Examples of using the library are presented on [godoc.org][GDE]
and in the [source library code][SCE].
